# Healthcare Insurance Charges Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for healthcare insurance charges using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The model predicts insurance costs based on various demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, number of children, and region. The goal is to develop an accurate and interpretable model that can assist insurance companies in estimating charges for potential customers and individuals in understanding the factors influencing insurance costs.

## Methodology

    1. Data Collection: Utilized a dataset containing information about individuals' demographics, lifestyle, and insurance charges.
    2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to gain insights into variable relationships, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of insurance charges.
    4. Model Building: Developed a predictive model using linear regression to predict insurance charges based on the available features.
    5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
    6. Model Interpretation: Examined the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of different factors on insurance charges.
    7. Visualization: Created visualizations, such as scatter plots of residuals, to further analyze the model's performance and understand the relationship between actual and predicted charges.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable predictive model that can assist both insurance companies and individuals in estimating healthcare insurance charges. By understanding the factors influencing insurance costs, individuals can make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage, while insurance companies can improve pricing strategies and risk assessment. Additionally, the insights gained from this analysis can contribute to discussions about healthcare policy and affordability.

## Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis
Dataset
1. Age: Integer indicating the age of the primary beneficiary(excluding those above 64yrs, since they are generally covered by the government).
2. Sex: Policy holder's gender, either male or female.
3. BMI: Body Mass Index, which provides a sense of how over or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kg) divided by height (in metres) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
